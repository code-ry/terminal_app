## Features

### Items and Attributes

At the start of the game, the user can choose from a range of characters to customize their play style. Each character will have different strengths and weakness represented by attridutes which will effect game-play. The user will be able to choose a limited amount of items to carry which will also adjust their characters attributes. Throughout the game a user will come across different items with which they can swap out with current ones in their inventory.

### Battle

Throughout the game the user will encounter enemies that they must overcome to progress. To overcome the enemy the user will battle the computer in a turn based random 'dice-roll' style. Whoever rolls the highest number wins that attack and damage is dealt to the opposing side. The battle ends when one side is reduced to 0 health after an attack is made.

### Puzzle

Along the journey the User will come across a mysterious character. To get past this character the user must complete a puzzle. The mysterious character will choose a random 5 letter word from a selected list, then give the user a clue to what the word is.
